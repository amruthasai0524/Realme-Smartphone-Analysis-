Realme Smartphone Analysis – README
This project performs end‑to‑end web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Realme smartphones listed on Flipkart to understand pricing, specifications, customer engagement, and discount strategies.​

Project overview :
Scrapes 9,700+ Realme smartphone records from Flipkart using Python and BeautifulSoup.​

Cleans and structures data by standardizing prices, extracting RAM/ROM and colours, parsing discounts, and separating ratings from reviews.​

Uses visualizations to study price distribution, popular RAM–ROM combinations, colour variants, ratings, reviews, and discount ranges.​

Key insights:
Realme’s portfolio is predominantly mid‑range, with 6GB/128GB and 8GB/128GB models driving volume and higher RAM/ROM configurations forming a smaller premium segment.​

Average ratings remain around 4.3–4.4/5 across price bands and colours, indicating strong value‑for‑money perception and consistent customer satisfaction.​

Specifications correlate strongly with price, while discounts typically range between about 5–33%, supporting a strategy where budget models drive volume and premium models drive margin.​

Tech stack:
Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn (and related data/visualization libraries).​

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.​

You can place this content in your README.md and then add sections for installation, project structure, how to run the notebooks/scripts, and future work as needed.
